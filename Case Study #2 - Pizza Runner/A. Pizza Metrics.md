  * Create a temporary table ```#customer_orders_temp``` from ```customer_orders``` table:
  	* Convert ```null``` values and ```'null'``` text values in ```exclusions``` and ```extras``` into blank ```''```.
  
  ```TSQL
  SELECT

    customer_id,
    pizza_id,

      	END AS extras,
    order_time
  INTO #customer_orders_temp
  FROM customer_orders;
  
  SELECT *

### Q1. How many pizzas were ordered?
```TSQL
SELECT 
	 count(pizza_id) as total_pizza_order
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders
;
```
| total_pizza_order |
|--------------|
| 14           |

---
### Q2. How many pizzas were ordered?
```TSQL
SELECT 
	 count(distinct order_id) as total_pizza_order
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```
| total_pizza_order |
|--------------|
| 10           |

---
### Q3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
```TSQL
WITH customer_orders as (
SELECT 
	 order_id, customer_id, pizza_id,
     CASE WHEN exclusions ='null' or exclusions =''  then  null else exclusions end exclusions ,
     CASE WHEN extras='null' or extras =''  then  null else extras end extras ,
     order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders
  ),
  
  runner_orders as (
  SELECT 
	 order_id, runner_id, 
     CASE WHEN pickup_time ='null'  then  null else pickup_time end pickup_time,
     CASE WHEN distance ='null'   then  null else distance end distance ,
     CASE WHEN duration='null'   then  null else duration end duration ,
     CASE WHEN cancellation ='null' or cancellation =''  then  null else cancellation end cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders )
SELECT 
 		runner_id,
        count(distinct cu.order_id) orders
FROM
	customer_orders cu 
    JOIN runner_orders ru 
   	ON cu.order_id = ru.order_id
WHERE
	cancellation is null
GROUP BY  runner_id
ORDER BY  runner_id
;
```
| runner_id | orders             |
|-----------|--------------------|
| 1         | 4                  |
| 2         | 3                  |
| 3         | 1                  |
---
### Q4. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
Approach 1: Use subquery.
```TSQL
SELECT 
  p.pizza_name,
  COUNT(*) AS deliver_count
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
JOIN pizza_names p 
  ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
WHERE c.order_id IN (
    SELECT order_id 
    FROM #runner_orders_temp
    WHERE cancellation IS NULL)
GROUP BY p.pizza_name;
```

Approach 2: Use JOIN.
```TSQL
SELECT 
  p.pizza_name,
  COUNT(*) AS deliver_count
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
JOIN pizza_names p 
  ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN #runner_orders_temp r 
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY p.pizza_name;
```

| pizza_name | deliver_count  |
|------------|----------------|
| Meatlovers | 9              |
| Vegetarian | 3              |

---
### Q5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
```TSQL
SELECT 
 		customer_id	,
        pizza_name,
        count( cu.pizza_id) pizzas
FROM
	customer_orders cu 
    LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pi 
   	ON cu.pizza_id = pi.pizza_id
    LEFT JOIN runner_orders ru
    ON cu.order_id=ru.order_id
GROUP BY  customer_id,pizza_name
ORDER BY  customer_id
;
```

| customer_id | Meatlovers |
|-------------|------------|
| 101         | Meatlovers |
| 101         | Vegetarian | 
| 102         | Vegetarian |
| 102         | Meatlovers | 
| 103         | Meatlovers |
| 103         | Meatlovers |
| 103         | Vegetarian |
| 104         | Meatlovers |
| 105         | Vegetarian |

### Q6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
```TSQL
SELECT MAX(pizza_count) AS max_count
FROM (
  SELECT 
    c.order_id,
    COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS pizza_count
  FROM #customer_orders_temp c
  JOIN #runner_orders_temp r 
    ON c.order_id = r.order_id
  WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
  GROUP BY c.order_id
) tmp;
```
| max_count  |
|------------|
| 3          |

---
### Q7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
```TSQL
SELECT 
  c.customer_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions != '' OR extras != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_change,
  SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions = '' AND extras = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_change
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
JOIN #runner_orders_temp r 
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
```
| customer_id | has_change | no_change  |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 101         | 0          | 2          |
| 102         | 0          | 3          |
| 103         | 3          | 0          |
| 104         | 2          | 1          |
| 105         | 1          | 0          |

### Q8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
```TSQL
SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions != '' AND extras != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS change_both
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
JOIN #runner_orders_temp r 
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL;
```
| change_both  |
|--------------|
| 1            |

---
### Q9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
```TSQL
SELECT 
  DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) AS hour_of_day,
  COUNT(order_id) AS pizza_volume
FROM #customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)
ORDER BY hour_of_day;
```
| hour_of_day | pizza_volume  |
|-------------|---------------|
| 11          | 1             |
| 13          | 3             |
| 18          | 3             |

```TSQL
SELECT 
  DATENAME(weekday, order_time) AS week_day,
  COUNT(order_id) AS order_volume
FROM #customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY DATENAME(weekday, order_time);
```
| week_day  | order_volume  |
|-----------|---------------|
| Friday    | 1             |
