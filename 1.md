## Business Task 
Danny wants to analyze customer data to gain insights into their visiting patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. He aims to establish a deeper connection with his customers to enhance their experience. Specifically, he plans to use these insights to decide whether to expand the current customer loyalty program. To facilitate the analysis, Danny needs help generating basic datasets that his team can easily inspect without using SQL directly. Despite privacy concerns, he has provided a sample of customer data for the purpose of creating fully functioning SQL queries to address his questions

## Question and Solution
What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

````sql
SELECT 
	  customer_id,
      sum(price) as total_amount    
FROM
	 dannys_diner.sales sa
JOIN
	 dannys_diner.menu me
ON 
	sa.product_id=me.product_i
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY
	customer_id;
````
|  customer_id | total_pay  |
|---|---|
|A	|76|
|B	|74|
|C	|36|

How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
Which item was the most popular for each customer?
Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
